The DublinAI Fellowship is an intensive, eight-week professional development program for PhD grads and postdoctoral researchers that help's bridge the gap to a full-time career in data & AI related fields. Careers include Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Analyst or niche AI expert (NLP, Computer Vision etc).

As part of the 2020 program, the cohort completed a team mini-sprint project focussed on customer churn.
